## Display Current Domain

This project's static Pages are built by @chiuyau, following the steps
defined in [`.index.yml`](.index.yml):

```
const capitalize = (s) => {
  if (typeof s !== 'string') return ''
  return s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1)
}
```

The above example expects to put all your HTML files between the `<script></script>` tag.

## Can I fork this project?
Yes, Absolutely.

## Troubleshooting
1. `<script></script>` tag is missing.
2. Common HTML tag is missing.
